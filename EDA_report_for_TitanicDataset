# Exploratory Data Analysis: Titanic Dataset

## 1. Introduction

This report presents an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and potential factors that influenced passenger survival. We will use various data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights and answer key questions.

## 2. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

**Libraries:**

* Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames for efficient data handling.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
* Missingno: Used for visualizing missing data patterns.
* Scipy: Used for statistical computation and inference.

**Steps:**

1. Import necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, missingno, and scipy.stats.
2. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.
3. Visualize missing data using `msno.matrix()`.

**Key Insights:**

* The dataset contains information about passengers' demographics, travel details, and survival status.
* There are missing values in the 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

**Steps:**

1. Handle missing values:
    * Impute missing 'Age' values with the mean age.
    * Fill missing 'Cabin' values with 'UNKNOWN'.
    * Fill missing 'Embarked' values with the mode.
2. Calculate descriptive statistics using `df.describe()` and value counts using `df[col].value_counts()`.

**Key Insights:**

* The average age of passengers was around 30 years.
* Most passengers were in the third class (Pclass 3).
* More males than females were on board.
* Most passengers embarked from Southampton (Embarked 'S').

## 4. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

* Histograms and Box Plots: Used to visualize the distribution of numerical features ('Age', 'Pclass', 'Survived').
* Correlation Matrix and Pair Plots: Used to identify relationships between numerical features.

**Steps:**

1. Create histograms and box plots for numerical features to understand their distribution and potential outliers.
2. Calculate the correlation matrix using `df.corr()` and visualize it using a heatmap.
3. Generate pair plots using `sns.pairplot()` to explore relationships between pairs of numerical features, considering survival status ('Survived').

**Key Insights:**

* Age and Fare appear to have some correlation with survival.
* There might be a relationship between Pclass and survival.

## 5. Statistical Testing

**Steps:**

1. Perform chi-square tests for categorical features ('Sex', 'Pclass', 'Embarked') to assess their relationship with survival.
2. Conduct t-tests for numerical features ('Age', 'Fare') to compare the distributions between survivors and non-survivors.

**Key Insights:**

* **Chi-Square Test:** p-values less than 0.05 suggest a significant relationship with survival.
    * Sex: p < 0.05 (significant)
    * Pclass: p < 0.05 (significant)
    * Embarked: p < 0.05 (significant)

* **T-Test:** p-values less than 0.05 suggest a significant difference in means between survivors and non-survivors.
    * Age: p < 0.05 (significant)
    * Pclass: p < 0.05 (significant)

## 7. Conclusion

The EDA reveals key insights into factors that may have influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.

* **Sex:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
* **Pclass:** Passengers in higher classes (1st and 2nd) had a better chance of survival compared to those in 3rd class.
* **Age:** Younger passengers tended to have a higher survival rate.
* **Embarked:** The port of embarkation may have played a role in survival.
* **Fare:** Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
